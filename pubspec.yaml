# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
  # The 'pluginClass' specifies the class (in Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, etc.)
  # which should be registered in the plugin registry. This is required for
  # using method channels.
  # The Android 'package' specifies package in which the registered class is.
  # This is required for using method channels on Android.
  # The 'ffiPlugin' specifies that native code should be built and bundled.
  # This is required for using `dart:ffi`.
  # All these are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
  # adding or updating assets for this project.

    # -------------------
  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - packages/tawakkalna_sdk_flutter/assets/web/twk_v1.js
    - packages/tawakkalna_sdk_flutter/assets/web/twk_v1_fake.js
    - packages/tawakkalna_sdk_flutter/assets/web/twk_v2.js
    - packages/tawakkalna_sdk_flutter/assets/web/twk_v2_fake.js
    - packages/tawakkalna_sdk_flutter/assets/web/twkhelper.js
    - assets/mock_profile1.0.2.json
